Web developer since 2020.  
For now, have been completed several projects, including commercial ones that were done from scratch.  
I have extensive experience in deploying and administering Windows and Ubuntu operating systems, as well as local and virtual private networks. Development is carried out on the remote personal Ubuntu server.

For React development, I've created esbuild based [custom bundler](https://github.com/rus-sharafiev/dev-server) with a web server and written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

The technology stack includes:
- HTML5
- CSS3 / SCSS / LESS
- TypeScript / ES6+
  - ReactJS 18+ (FC)
    - Redux / RTK
    - React Router 6
  - Web components
  - NodeJS
    - [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
    - [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
    - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
    - SSG (React DOM Server)
 - PostgreSQL
 - Golang (training in progress)

Development tools includes VS Code, esbuild, nginx
